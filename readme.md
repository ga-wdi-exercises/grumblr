# GRUMBLR

JAMJAR has another site request!(of course they do....)

So many people have misgivings about so many different things. JAMJAR would like to make a site that users can post their gripes about things.(aka GRUMBLRS.. this is totally not a todo app)

Here's what you need to do to build this for us!

- Fork this repo
- use the existing rails app(which is just a brand new rails app), to create a back end for GRUMBLR
  - Grumblrs should have a body and author, both strings
  - use the reminder app and song app made in class as reference!
- Once the rails back end has been created:
  - add backbone dependencies(like in class)
  - add folders and files to your asset pipeline to incorporate backbone collection and models

Create a new readme.md file and place in it, the following JS:

- Create 4 new grumblr backbone objects.
- set attributes of a new grumblr using `.set()` for one of the grumblrs
- create a grumblr backbone collection object that contains the 4 grumblr objects above
- create a new grumblr within that collection that gets saved to the database

** BONUS
Generate a view using your Grumblr objects and/or collections.
